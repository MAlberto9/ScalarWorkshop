<h1>Scalar Workshop at Digital Matters (UUtah)</h1>
<p><b>by Maria Alberto</b> (Digital Matters graduate fellow, fall 2019)</p>
<p> <a href="https://scalar.me/anvc/"> Scalar</a> is an open-source authoring platform built to support long-form, multi-media scholarship. It enables authors to integrate their own writing alongside content from a variety of academic and popular sources, all without the need to learn extensive coding or to pay for hosting content.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This workshop will be a hands-on introduction to Scalar, so attendees are encouraged to bring a laptop or tablet capable of Internet access. <i>(Both types of device are available to check out from the Knowledge Commons if needed!)</i></p>

<p>We'll begin with a brief look at digital publishing, move on to an introduction of Scalar and its features, and conclude with some time for participants to try Scalar out for themselves. Previous experience with Scalar or personal Scalar account are not required in order to participate!</p> 

<h2>A Brief Look at Digital Publishing</h2>
<p>There's not necessarily a consensus on what digital publishing is, or what it should be used for. "Being" published? Preserving scholarly work? Publicizing it or making it accessible? <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/Which-Publications-Matter-at/247192">Here's some related thoughts</a> from <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i>, too. . .</p>
  
 <p>To make things even more complicated, there are many available venues for digital publishing, and each has its own reputation, affordances, and shortcomings. For example, we might think about the time, costs, coding, and accessibility that come with each of these options. </p>
<p><ul>
  <li><b>commercial platforms/content providers</b> (ex: <a href="https://medium.com/@cfiesler"><i>Medium</i></a>)</li>
  <li><b>open access academic journals</b> (ex: <a href="http://epubs.utah.edu/">all at UUtah</a>, <a href="http://epubs.utah.edu/index.php/HJP"><i> Hinckley</i></a>)</li>
