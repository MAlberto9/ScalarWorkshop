<h1>Scalar Workshop (Digital Matters, The University of Utah)</h1>

<b>by Maria Alberto</b> (graduate fellow, fall 2019)
<p> <a href="https://scalar.me/anvc/"> Scalar</a> is an open-source authoring platform built to support long-form, multi-media scholarship. It enables authors to integrate their own writing alongside content from a variety of academic and popular sources, all without the need to learn a new coding language or to pay for hosting content.</p>

<h2>Workshop Overview</h2>
<p>This workshop will be a hands-on introduction to Scalar, so attendees are encouraged to bring a laptop or tablet capable of Internet access. (Both types of device are available to check out from the Knowledge Commons)</p>

<p>We'll begin with a brief look at digital publishing, continue with a visit to some Scalar projects, include an overview of Scalar functionalities, and conclude with some time for participants to try Scalar out for themselves. Previous experience with Scalar or personal Scalar account are not required in order to participate!</p>
